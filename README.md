# C++ Assembly Line Simulation
This C++ project simulates an assembly line with multiple stations, designed to demonstrate and apply Object-Oriented Programming principles. The assembly line consists of a set of workstations, each holding a specific stock of items required for processing customer orders.

# Project Overview
- Assembly Line Structure: The assembly line is composed of multiple workstations, and each workstation holds a unique set of stock items necessary for processing customer orders.

- Line Manager: A line manager is responsible for moving customer orders along the assembly line, ensuring that orders are fulfilled as requested.

- Customer Orders: Each customer order is a list of items that need to be filled. These orders are processed by moving them through the various stations on the assembly line.

- Order Processing: Stations process customer orders by checking if the required item is in stock. If an item is in stock and matches the order, it is filled. The line manager continues to move orders until all orders are processed.

- Incomplete Orders: Orders may remain incomplete if there is a lack of inventory at one or more stations. These incomplete orders are tracked and reported at the end of the simulation.

# Project Milestones
This project is divided into three milestones to guide the development process:

- Implementation: Implement the core functionality of the assembly line, stations, line manager, and order processing.

- Debugging: Debug the code to ensure that orders are processed correctly, inventory is managed properly, and the assembly line functions as expected.

- Execution: Execute the simulation and observe the completed orders and any incomplete orders due to inventory shortages. Ensure that the project behaves as intended.

# Project Complexity
This project is more complex than the workshops and serves as an excellent opportunity to apply and refine your C++ Object-Oriented Programming skills. Plan your work accordingly and follow the milestones to ensure a successful implementation of the assembly line simulation.
